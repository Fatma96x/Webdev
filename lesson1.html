  <h2>About</h2>

</head>

   <p>I created this blog to inspire you to start your own sewing journey! <br> I started mine when I was 19 - that was almost 7 years ago! - I'm completely self taught and have been sewing 'on and off' during those years.  <br> Though I'm no professional, I absolutely enjoy sewing and believe it's an essential - must learn skill.<br>
   I'll be sharing all the 'tips & tricks' I've learnt over the past couple of years - including simple tutorials, helpful resources, and much more! </p>
